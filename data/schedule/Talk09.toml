description = "A variety of monitoring efforts have played important roles in informing scientists and policymakers about the dynamics of the Covid-19 pandemic. As more focus has turned toward the significance that new Sars-Cov-2 strains, or variants, may have in the context of things like ease of transmission, disease severity, and vaccine efficacy, some monitoring efforts have in turn expanded to not only test for the presence of Sars-Cov-2, but also to leverage genomic sequencing technologies to document the identity of the specific variants present in a patient or location. As part of a broader monitoring program, the State of Ohio has incorporated such Sars-Cov-2 surveillance at wastewater treatment facilities, which have a unique property of being able to provide information on a large target population with a sample from a single location. However, such samples also present analytical challenges, as most software developed and used for identification of Sars-Cov-2 variants to date has focused on samples from individual patients, and is not able to effectively evaluate samples that contain mixtures of variants. In this presentation, Iâ€™ll discuss MixViR, a work-in-progress R package designed to address the challenges of detecting and identifying multiple viral variants from a single high-throughput genomic DNA sequencing sample."
