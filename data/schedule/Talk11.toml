description = "I think there are a lot of folks out there who get involved with groups as a way to start building their expertise in R and analytics in general. I know when I started, I was completely lost and had no idea where to start; if it weren't for the larger analytics and R community, there's no way I would be as far along as I am now. My plan for the talk would consist of 4 main (brief) ideas: 1) a bit of my background (which had zero to do with programming) 2) How I got started and what I do currently as a senior digital analyst in insurance 3) a dump of great resources for folks that are just getting started 4) tips and tricks/things to keep in mind for the new R user or those curious about trying it out. Would likely also present a small side project I created as an inspiration for people to seek out projects that interest them in order to practice. "
