description = "Tree-based models are top performers, but handling categorical variables can be a challenge. Several R packages do have support for factors, but they have different approaches and usually can't handle an unlimited number of categories. CatBoost has a sophisticated approach based on target encoding that performs well and overcomes such limitations. I'll briefly go over those other approaches, outline how CatBoost handles factors, and end with an example."
